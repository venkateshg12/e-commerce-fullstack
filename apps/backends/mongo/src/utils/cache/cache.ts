/*
  Cache-aside over a dedicated Redis. Nothing here ever throws: every failure — Redis down, slow,
  or switched off — degrades to "cache miss", and the caller reads Mongo as it would without a
  cache. The circuit breaker (shared implementation with the rate limiter) stops a hung Redis from
  adding its timeout to every request: after repeated failures calls skip Redis entirely until a
  probe succeeds.

  Invalidation is by versioned namespace, not by deleting keys. Each domain has a counter; every key
  embeds the current counter of each domain its data came from; a write bumps the counter, so old
  keys are simply never read again and age out through their TTL. That is O(1) however many keys a
  domain has, and it closes the race where a slow request that read old data writes it back after an
  invalidation — it writes under the old version, which nobody reads any more.

  editing one product leaves every other product's cached page alone (see product.service.ts).
