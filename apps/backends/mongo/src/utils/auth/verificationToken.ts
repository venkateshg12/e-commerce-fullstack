 * Email-verification and password-reset links are bearer credentials: whoever holds the token can

 * a log is enough to reset any account, so only a digest is persisted — the raw token exists in
 * the email and nowhere else.
 *
 * SHA-256 rather than bcrypt on purpose: the token is 256 bits of CSPRNG output, so there is no
 * guessable secret to slow an attacker down, and a fast hash keeps the lookup a single indexed
 * query instead of a scan-and-compare.
